Since the training set involves a lot of files, we just give the pt files in **../../processed/dev_2** folder.

Once we get the pt file, we no longer need the structure file in **Ar/gjfs_and_logs** and **R/gjfs_and_logs**.  

There are enough files left in this folder for training now.

- PS.
    **Ar/Ar_dict.json** and **R/R_dict.json** are generated automatically in the process of generating the pt file, no need to prepare it yourself, and do not delete it at will.
